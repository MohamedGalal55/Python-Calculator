# simple-python-calculator
simple calculator program written in Python. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, //, %, ^) on two numbers and stores the results of each calculation for future reference. The code also includes input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numbers and operators.
-   This repository contains a calculator program written in Python.
-   The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, //, %, ^) on two numbers.
-   Input validation is included to ensure that the user enters valid numbers and operators.
-   The program uses two main functions: "calculate" and "get_input".
-   The "calculate" function performs the main arithmetic operations when given two numbers and an arithmetic operator.
